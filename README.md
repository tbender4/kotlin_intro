# kotlin_intro

The following is a concise Intro to Programming course that's found in a college level yet using Kotlin. This course expects no prior experience and has been written for a novice audience in mind.

## Requirements

A command-line version of the compiler and any text editor is the only requirement. An IDE is not required but it is recommended to obtain Kotlin by installing the [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) as it is the easiest method to install, write, and run Kotlin code.

## Course Layout
This course is split into three sections:

1. Description
2. Example code
3. Practice problems
4. Final Summary

Practice problem solutions are found in a separate directory and should be used to verify work.

## Formatting:
Anything in **bold** should not be skimmed or ignored. It'll typically refer to vocabulary or anything otherwise critical.

Anything with a `subtle highlight` is typically a function, class, global variable, or anything else technical that is worth highlighting.
```
Multiline code snippets
will have a body-wide
highlight for improved readability.
```

# Final Note
Practice makes perfect. If you're feeling burnt out or can't manage a proper solution, it's **OK** to search for it. If the first few links cannot give you a good answer within the first few moments, that's **OK** too. Don't give up; don't be afraid to sleuth through documentation and resources. Mentally reward yourself for your progress.
