# kotlin_intro

The following is a concise Intro to Programming course that's found in a college level yet using Kotlin. This course expects no prior experience and has been written for a novice audience in mind.

## Requirements

A command-line version of the compiler and any text editor is the only requirement. An IDE is not required but it is recommended to obtain Kotlin by installing the [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) as it is the easiest method to install, write, and run Kotlin code.

# Final Note
Practice makes perfect. If you're feeling burnt out or can't manage a proper solution, it's **OK** to search for it. If the first few links cannot give you a good answer within the first few moments, that's **OK** too. Don't give up; don't be afraid to sleuth through documentation and resources. Mentally reward yourself for your progress.
